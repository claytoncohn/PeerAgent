    "query_logs_summary": "Group 1 students have started by initializing some constants but have not yet set up the necessary variables or the simulation loop. To progress, they should begin by initializing relevant variables such as x_position, x_velocity, and x_acceleration, and then define the conditions and logic for the simulation steps.",
    "domain_knowledge_retrieved": "'Updating variables' involves changing the values of existing variables based on calculations or events as the program or simulation runs. This could include updating them by setting them to specific values (e.g., x=6) or updating them relative to their previous values (e.g., x += 6).\n\n'Initializing variables' means setting environment variables to their starting values before using them in a program or simulation.\n\nUpdating Velocity Equation: velocity += acceleration*time. This means that the final velocity of an object (v_x) is calculated by adding the product of acceleration (a_x) and time (t) to the initial velocity (v_0x)."
