    "query_logs_summary": "Group 1 students report that their truck is not moving. This is because their model only initializes the SpeedLimit constant and does not include the necessary variable initializations or the simulation loop. To progress, students should begin by initializing relevant variables (such as x_position, x_velocity, and x_acceleration) and defining the necessary constants (such as DeltaT). They also need to implement the simulation loop to update the truck's position and velocity based on the conditions at each simulation step.",
    "domain_knowledge_retrieved": "'Updating variables' involves changing the values of existing variables based on calculations or events as the program or simulation runs. This could include updating them by setting them to specific values (e.g., x=6) or updating them relative to their previous values (e.g., x += 6).\n\n'Initializing variables' means setting environment variables to their starting values before using them in a program or simulation.\n\nUpdating Velocity Equation: velocity += acceleration*time. This means that the final velocity of an object (v_x) is calculated by adding the product of acceleration (a_x) and time (t) to the initial velocity (v_0x)."
