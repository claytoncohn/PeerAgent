    "query_logs_summary": "Group 1 students are unsure where to start and have not made significant progress in their computational model. They should begin by initializing relevant variables and defining the necessary constants. This includes setting up the initial position, velocity, acceleration, and other constants like SpeedLimit and DeltaT.",
    "domain_knowledge_retrieved": "'Initializing variables' means setting environment variables to their starting values before using them in a program or simulation.\n\n'Updating variables' involves changing the values of existing variables based on calculations or events as the program or simulation runs. This could include updating them by setting them to specific values (e.g., x=6) or updating them relative to their previous values (e.g., x += 6).\n\nDisplacement Equation: delta_x = v_0x*t + (1/2)*a_x*(t^2), where delta_x is the displacement (e.g., the lookahead distance), v_0x is the initial velocity, t is the time interval, and a_x is the acceleration. This equation states that the displacement, delta_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) multiplied by the time interval (t), plus one-half the object's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t) squared."
