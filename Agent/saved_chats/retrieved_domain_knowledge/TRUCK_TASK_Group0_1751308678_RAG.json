    "query_logs_summary": "Group 1 students have correctly initialized the necessary variables and constants, as evidenced by their [when greenflag clicked] block. However, their model is incomplete as it lacks the simulation loop and conditions to handle the truck's motion phases (acceleration, cruising, and deceleration). To progress, they need to implement the simulation step that updates the truck's position and velocity based on the current acceleration and includes conditions for cruising at the speed limit and decelerating before the stop sign. They should refer to the kinematic equations to correctly model these phases.",
    "domain_knowledge_retrieved": "'Updating variables' involves changing the values of existing variables based on calculations or events as the program or simulation runs. This could include updating them by setting them to specific values (e.g., x=6) or updating them relative to their previous values (e.g., x += 6).\n\nDisplacement Equation: delta_x = v_0x*t + (1/2)*a_x*(t^2), where delta_x is the displacement (e.g., the lookahead distance), v_0x is the initial velocity, t is the time interval, and a_x is the acceleration. This equation states that the displacement, delta_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) multiplied by the time interval (t), plus one-half the object's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t) squared.\n\nUpdating Position Equation: position += velocity*time. This means that an object's final position is calculated by adding the product of velocity and time to its initial position. "
