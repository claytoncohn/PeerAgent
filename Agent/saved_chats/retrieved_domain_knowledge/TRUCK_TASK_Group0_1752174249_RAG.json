    "query_logs_summary": "Group 1 students report that their truck is not moving. The issue lies in the absence of a simulation loop to update the truck's position and velocity over time. While they have correctly initialized the variables and constants, they need to implement a [Simulation Step] component that updates x_position and x_velocity based on the current x_acceleration and DeltaT. This involves using the kinematic equations to update these variables at each simulation step.",
    "domain_knowledge_retrieved": "'Updating variables' involves changing the values of existing variables based on calculations or events as the program or simulation runs. This could include updating them by setting them to specific values (e.g., x=6) or updating them relative to their previous values (e.g., x += 6).\n\nUpdating Position Equation: position += velocity*time. This means that an object's final position is calculated by adding the product of velocity and time to its initial position. \n\nDisplacement Equation: delta_x = v_0x*t + (1/2)*a_x*(t^2), where delta_x is the displacement (e.g., the lookahead distance), v_0x is the initial velocity, t is the time interval, and a_x is the acceleration. This equation states that the displacement, delta_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) multiplied by the time interval (t), plus one-half the object's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t) squared."
