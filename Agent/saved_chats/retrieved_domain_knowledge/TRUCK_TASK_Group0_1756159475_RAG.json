    "query_logs_summary": "Group 1 students report that their truck does not work, and their computational model shows that the simulation step is empty, with no logic to update the truck's position or velocity. Additionally, the disconnected blocks ([Not Connected]) do not affect the simulation. To progress, students should begin by initializing relevant variables and defining the necessary constants. They also need to implement the logic for updating the truck's position and velocity within the simulation step, ensuring they handle acceleration, cruising, and deceleration phases correctly.",
    "domain_knowledge_retrieved": "'Updating variables' involves changing the values of existing variables based on calculations or events as the program or simulation runs. This could include updating them by setting them to specific values (e.g., x=6) or updating them relative to their previous values (e.g., x += 6).\n\nDisplacement Equation: delta_x = v_0x*t + (1/2)*a_x*(t^2), where delta_x is the displacement (e.g., the lookahead distance), v_0x is the initial velocity, t is the time interval, and a_x is the acceleration. This equation states that the displacement, delta_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) multiplied by the time interval (t), plus one-half the object's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t) squared.\n\nUpdating Position Equation: position += velocity*time. This means that an object's final position is calculated by adding the product of velocity and time to its initial position. "
