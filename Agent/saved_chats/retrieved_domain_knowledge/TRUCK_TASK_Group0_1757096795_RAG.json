    "query_logs_summary": "Group 1 students report that their truck is not moving. The issue lies in their [simulation_step] component, which is currently empty. To resolve this, they need to implement the logic for updating the truck's position and velocity at each simulation step. Specifically, they should include blocks to change x_velocity by (x_acceleration)(*)(DeltaT) and change x_position by (x_velocity)(*)(DeltaT). Additionally, they should ensure that conditions for acceleration, cruising, and deceleration phases are correctly set. This will require understanding how to update variables based on kinematic equations and the phases of motion.",
    "domain_knowledge_retrieved": "Displacement Equation: delta_x = v_0x*t + (1/2)*a_x*(t^2), where delta_x is the displacement (e.g., the lookahead distance), v_0x is the initial velocity, t is the time interval, and a_x is the acceleration. This equation states that the displacement, delta_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) multiplied by the time interval (t), plus one-half the object's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t) squared.\n\nUpdating Velocity Equation: velocity += acceleration*time. This means that the final velocity of an object (v_x) is calculated by adding the product of acceleration (a_x) and time (t) to the initial velocity (v_0x).\n\n'Updating variables' involves changing the values of existing variables based on calculations or events as the program or simulation runs. This could include updating them by setting them to specific values (e.g., x=6) or updating them relative to their previous values (e.g., x += 6)."
