They also haven\u2019t added cruising or stopping conditions, and their constant name \u201cSpeed Limit\u201d may not match the expected \u201cSpeedLimit.\u201d Retrieve content on: discrete kinematic update equations (v \u2190 v + a\u0394t, x \u2190 x + v\u0394t), structuring the simulation step, and motion phases (accelerate, cruise at SpeedLimit, decelerate using the lookahead distance).",
    "domain_knowledge_retrieved": "Displacement Equation: delta_x = v_0x*t + (1/2)*a_x*(t^2), where delta_x is the displacement (e.g., the lookahead distance), v_0x is the initial velocity, t is the time interval, and a_x is the acceleration. This equation states that the displacement, delta_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) multiplied by the time interval (t), plus one-half the object's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t) squared.\n\nVelocity Squared Equation: v_x^2 = v_0x^2 + 2*a_x*delta_x, where v_x is the final velocity, v_0x is the initial velocity, a_x is the acceleration, and delta_x is the displacement (e.g., lookahead distance). This equation states that the final velocity (v_x) squared is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) squared, plus two times the object\u2019s acceleration (a_x) times the displacement (delta_x). \n\n'Updating variables' involves changing the values of existing variables based on calculations or events as the program or simulation runs. This could include updating them by setting them to specific values (e.g., x=6) or updating them relative to their previous values (e.g., x += 6)."
