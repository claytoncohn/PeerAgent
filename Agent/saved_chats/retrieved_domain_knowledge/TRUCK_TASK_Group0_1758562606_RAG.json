    "query_logs_summary": "Group 1 students have initialized most variables correctly, but there are issues with their conditions. The condition for cruising is incorrect; it should check if x_velocity is greater than the SpeedLimit, not less, to set acceleration to zero. Additionally, the condition for slowing down is incorrectly structured and should compare x_position to (StopSignPosition)(-)(28.125) to set x_acceleration to -4. The stopping condition is incomplete, as it lacks a proper comparison to stop the simulation when the truck reaches the stop sign. Students need to understand how to correctly implement these conditions using kinematic equations and logical comparisons.",
    "domain_knowledge_retrieved": "'Conditional statements' are 'if' statements used in programming to handle different cases (conditions). For instance, you can use conditional statements to update an object's 'speed' variable depending on if the object is accelerating or decelerating.\n\nDisplacement Equation: delta_x = v_0x*t + (1/2)*a_x*(t^2), where delta_x is the displacement (e.g., the lookahead distance), v_0x is the initial velocity, t is the time interval, and a_x is the acceleration. This equation states that the displacement, delta_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) multiplied by the time interval (t), plus one-half the object's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t) squared.\n\nUpdating Velocity Equation: velocity += acceleration*time. This means that the final velocity of an object (v_x) is calculated by adding the product of acceleration (a_x) and time (t) to the initial velocity (v_0x)."
