    "query_logs_summary": "Group 1 students are in the early stages of their model, with several disconnected blocks and no active simulation logic. They have initialized some constants like SpeedLimit and DeltaT, but these are not connected to any simulation logic. To progress, students should begin by connecting blocks to initialize relevant variables and define the necessary constants, ensuring they are part of a coherent simulation loop. They should also focus on setting up the simulation steps to update position and velocity based on acceleration and time.",
    "domain_knowledge_retrieved": "'Updating variables' involves changing the values of existing variables based on calculations or events as the program or simulation runs. This could include updating them by setting them to specific values (e.g., x=6) or updating them relative to their previous values (e.g., x += 6).\n\n'Initializing variables' means setting environment variables to their starting values before using them in a program or simulation.\n\nDisplacement Equation: delta_x = v_0x*t + (1/2)*a_x*(t^2), where delta_x is the displacement (e.g., the lookahead distance), v_0x is the initial velocity, t is the time interval, and a_x is the acceleration. This equation states that the displacement, delta_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) multiplied by the time interval (t), plus one-half the object's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t) squared."
