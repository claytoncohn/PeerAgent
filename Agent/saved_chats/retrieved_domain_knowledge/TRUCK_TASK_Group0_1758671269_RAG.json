This equation states that the displacement, delta_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) multiplied by the time interval (t), plus one-half the object's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t) squared.\n\nVelocity Squared Equation: v_x^2 = v_0x^2 + 2*a_x*delta_x, where v_x is the final velocity, v_0x is the initial velocity, a_x is the acceleration, and delta_x is the displacement (e.g., lookahead distance). This equation states that the final velocity (v_x) squared is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) squared, plus two times the object\u2019s acceleration (a_x) times the displacement (delta_x). \n\nUpdating Position Equation: position += velocity*time. This means that an object's final position is calculated by adding the product of velocity and time to its initial position. "
