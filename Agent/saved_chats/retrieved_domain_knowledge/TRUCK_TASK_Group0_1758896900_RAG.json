        "summary": "Your program is essentially empty: you have only \u201c[when green flag clicked]\u201d with an empty \u201cif (no value) [no value]\u201d. Missing pieces include: variable initialization (e.g., set SpeedLimit=15, x_position=-60, x_velocity=0, DeltaT=0.1, x_acceleration=4), starting the simulation, the simulation step updates (change x_velocity by x_acceleration*DeltaT; change x_position by x_velocity*DeltaT), the cruise condition (set x_acceleration to 0 at SpeedLimit), the stopping logic using the 28.125 m lookahead (set x_acceleration to -4 when near the stop sign), and the stop condition. Immediate next step (ZPD): under the green flag, add set blocks for SpeedLimit, x_position, x_velocity, DeltaT, x_acceleration, then Start Simulation.",
        "recommended_domain_knowledge": "How to initialize Truck Task variables and constants and structure the simulation loop with kinematic updates and the 28.125 m lookahead stopping rule.",
        "knowledge": "Displacement Equation: delta_x = v_0x*t + (1/2)*a_x*(t^2), where delta_x is the displacement (e.g., the lookahead distance), v_0x is the initial velocity, t is the time interval, and a_x is the acceleration. This equation states that the displacement, delta_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) multiplied by the time interval (t), plus one-half the object's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t) squared.\n\n'Updating variables' involves changing the values of existing variables based on calculations or events as the program or simulation runs. This could include updating them by setting them to specific values (e.g., x=6) or updating them relative to their previous values (e.g., x += 6).\n\nVelocity Squared Equation: v_x^2 = v_0x^2 + 2*a_x*delta_x, where v_x is the final velocity, v_0x is the initial velocity, a_x is the acceleration, and delta_x is the displacement (e.g., lookahead distance). This equation states that the final velocity (v_x) squared is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) squared, plus two times the object\u2019s acceleration (a_x) times the displacement (delta_x). "
