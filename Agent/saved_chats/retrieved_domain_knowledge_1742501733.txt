    "query_logs_summary": "Group 1 students report that their truck speeds up correctly but does not slow down. In the Group 1 Student Computational Model, they have correctly implemented the acceleration and position updates, but they are missing the conditions to handle the cruising and deceleration phases. Specifically, they need to add conditions to set the acceleration to 0 when the truck reaches the speed limit and to set the acceleration to -4 m/s\u00b2 when the truck is within the lookahead distance of the stop sign. To address this, students need to understand the kinematic equations to calculate the lookahead distance and implement the necessary conditions for deceleration.",
    "domain_knowledge_retrieved": "Displacement Equation: delta_x = v_0x*t + (1/2)*a_x*(t^2), where delta_x is the displacement (e.g., the lookahead distance), v_0x is the initial velocity, t is the time interval, and a_x is the acceleration. This equation states that the displacement, delta_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) multiplied by the time interval (t), plus one-half the object's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t) squared.\n\nVelocity Squared Equation: v_x^2 = v_0x^2 + 2*a_x*delta_x, where v_x is the final velocity, v_0x is the initial velocity, a_x is the acceleration, and delta_x is the displacement (e.g., lookahead distance). This equation states that the final velocity (v_x) squared is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) squared, plus two times the object\u2019s acceleration (a_x) times the displacement (delta_x). \n\nUpdating Velocity Equation: velocity += acceleration*time. This means that the final velocity of an object (v_x) is calculated by adding the product of acceleration (a_x) and time (t) to the initial velocity (v_0x)."
