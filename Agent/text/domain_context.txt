Final Velocity Equation: v_x = v_0x + a_x*t, where v_x is the final velocity, v_0x is the initial velocity, a_x is the acceleration, and t is the time interval. This equation states that the final velocity, v_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) plus the truck's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t).
Displacement Equation: delta_x = v_0x*t + (1/2)*a_x*(t^2), where delta_x is the displacement (e.g., the lookahead distance), v_0x is the initial velocity, t is the time interval, and a_x is the acceleration. This equation states that the displacement, delta_x, is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) multiplied by the time interval (t), plus one half the truck's acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the time interval (t) squared.
Velocity Squared Equation: v_x^2 = v_0x^2 + 2*a_x*delta_x, where v_x is the final velocity,v_0x is the initial velocity, a_x is the acceleration, and delta_x is the displacement (e.g., lookahead distance). This equation states that the final velocity (v_x) squared is equal to the initial velocity (v_0x) squared, plus 2 times the truck's acceleration (a_x) times the displacement (delta_x).
