## A collaborative "knowledgeable peer" agent for C2STEM

This is ongoing dissertation work. The current implementation involves RAG-based domain knowledge retrieval and prompt engineering, with future iterations to include:<br>
1. Learner modeling
2. Dialogue management
3. A lightweight, fine-tuned, open LLM

## Steps to run the code

1. Setup conda environment

conda env create -f agent_env.yml
conda activate C2STEM_Agent

2. Run the main file
